This repository provides a solution for automating website ranking and keyword analysis using [MATLAB速](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). 
By leveraging MATLAB's command-line interfaces with popular search engines, you can effortlessly:
1. Retrieve information about your ranking in search results.
2. Compute the SEO score of your webpage with well-known methods.
3. Research your competitor's keywords with website crawling.

## Examples

### Check if your website is in the top 10 Google search results

Evaluate the effectiveness of your website's SEO by using the [Google Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/) API key to check if your website appears in the top search results for a specific keyword.

```matlab
googleEngine = googleapi.SearchEngine(); % class included in this repository
keyword = "matlab online"; % search word

websites = getTopSitesInBrowserSearch(keyword, googleEngine, 'maxSites', 10)
```
The above example demonstrates how to retrieve the top 10 search results from Google for the keyword "matlab online". By executing the code, you will obtain a list of websites that rank in the top search results. This information can provide valuable insights into your website's visibility and SEO performance.

### Compute the SEO score of your website

Use the functions included in this repository to compute your website's SEO score for a specific keyword, using a variety of scoring methods.

```matlab
website = "https://www.mathworks.com/";
keyword = "artificial intelligence";
score1 = getPageScoreForKeyword(website, keyword, method="KeywordDensity")
score2 = getPageScoreForKeyword(website, keyword, method="BacklinksFromTop10")
```

You can use [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) as a scoring method. 
The tool uses [MatGPT](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/126665-matgpt/) to connect MATLAB to the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) and ask ChatGPT for a SEO score.

```matlab
score3 = getPageScoreForKeyword(website, keyword, method="ChatGPT")
```

Feel free to explore the repository and adapt the code to suit your specific needs.
